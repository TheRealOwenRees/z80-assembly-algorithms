# Z80 Assembly Algorithms

## My attempt at solving common alogorithmic challenges in Z80 assembly, to solidify my learning

Z80 assembly lacks native multiplication and division instructions and operates primarily with 8-bit arithmetic.

In these solutions, I've aimed to stay within 8-bit constraints, using combined registers where overflow might occur.

I have not used any firmware or system-specific commands, in order to keep the code as portable and platform-independent as possible.

All results are returned in the A register, unless otherwise noted.
